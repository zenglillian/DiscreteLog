# DiscreteLog
Created by: Lillian Zeng; Advisor: Dr. Ghaith. A. Hiary \n
Implementations for discrete logarithm algorithms that solve the discrete log problem in a group. I have implemented those algorithms for the group (Z/pZ)*, where p is a prime number. \n
All of the following implementations used GNU MP Bignum Library to do arithmetic on very large numbers.
