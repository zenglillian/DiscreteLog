# DiscreteLog
Created by Lillian Zeng; Advisor: Dr. Ghaith Hiary <br />
Implementations for discrete logarithm algorithms that solve the discrete log problem in a group. I have implemented those algorithms for the group (Z/pZ)*, where p is a prime number.<br/>
All of the implementations used C++ and GNU MP Bignum Library to do arithmetic on very large numbers. <br /> <br/>
