# DiscreteLog
Implementations for discrete logarithm algorithms that solve the discrete log problem in a group. I have implemented those algorithms for the group (Z/pZ)*, where p is a prime number.
All of the following implementations used GNU MP Bignum Library to do arithmetic on very large numbers.
